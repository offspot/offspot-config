## Scripts Usage

Launched via `offspot-runtime-config-fromfile`, it:

- reads a YAML config file and changes the offspot configuration accordingly.
- starts associated services

Its primary goal is to allow one to change some key offspot configuration upon next boot by changing one file (stored in FAT32 `/boot` –so writable anywhere), following a descriptive format.

**Notes**:

- It is **not a configuration reference**. It only lists the changes requested (whatever the status of those settings) at next boot. In an already configured system the file should be an empty YAML document (`---`).
- While `-fromfile` reads a YAML file, it mostly runs individual, feature-specific scripts that takes parameters on the command-line.
- it's a configuration tool that must be ran as root.


```sh
offspot-runtime-config-fromfile --debug /boot/offspot.yaml
```

- `--debug` will show you what exact parameters were passed to individual scripts so you can manually launch them should there be an issue.
- this script is meant to be run automaticaly on boot (via systemd) **before `docker-compose.service`**.
- It returns `0` on success, `1` on general failures and `2` on misconfiguration (invalid parameter). Same goes for individual scripts.
- it starts `hostapd`, `dnsmasq` and `iptables-restore` automatically. If you start it on boot, disable them (`systemctl disable hostapd dnsmasq`)

## Installation

**⚠️ Warning**: only tested on offspot base-image (raspiOS bullseye)

```sh
apt install hostapd dnsmasq dhcpcd5 python3-yaml python3-pip
systemctl unmask hostapd
systemctl disable hostapd dnsmasq
pip3 install offspot-config
```

## Library usage

```sh
pip3 install offspot-config
```

```py
from offspot_runtime.checks import is_valid_ipv4

# CheckResponse can be treated as a boolean
if is_valid_ipv4("10.0.0.1"):
   …

# CheckResponse exposes `.passed` (`bool`) and `.help_text` (`str`)
check = is_valid_ipv4("10.0.0.a")
if not check.passed:
    raise SystemExit(check.help_text)

# Directly raise a `ValueError` exception
is_valid_ipv4("10.0.0.a").raise_for_status()
```

## `offspot.yaml` format

`offspot.yaml` is composed of a single `object` with predefined candidate members.

- No member is required.
- Unknown members are simply ignored.
- No relation between first-level members.

### Valid first-level members

| Member       | Kind      | Function   |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| `timezone`   | `string`  | Set Host timezone                                      |
| `hostname`   | `string`  | Set machine's hostname (not domain, see `ap`).         |
| `ethernet`   | `object`  | Set network configuration for ethernet interface       |
| `ap`         | `object`  | Set WiFi AP configuration for wireless interface       |
| `containers` | `object`  | Builds the docker-compose file                         |

### `timezone`

Must be a valid timezone. Get a complete list with:

```sh
timedatectl list-timezones
```

**⚠️ Warning**: timezones are **case-sentitive**. `Africa/Bamako` works but `Africa/bamako` or `utc` doesn't.

Example:

```yaml
---
timezone: Europe/Berlin
```


### `hostname`

Must be alphanumeric string up to 63 characters. Can be composed of multiple (max 64) of those, separated by a single dot. Total length must be under 256 characters.

Example:

```yaml
---
hostname: library-lab-pi23
```

**Note**: this is not the domain name on the network. See `ap` for this. `hostname` is mostly useless.

### `ethernet`

`network` is itself a single `object`.

| Member       | Kind      | Required | Function   |
|--------------|-----------|----------|------------|
| `type    `   | `string`  | **yes**  | Either `dhcp` or `static`                   |
| `address`    | `string`  | **`static`** | Static IPv4 adress to set                |
| `routers`    | `string`  | **`static`** | Space-separated IPv4 addresses to use as gateways. Use any different address inside subnet if not using it. |
| `dns`        | `string`  | **`static`** | Space-separated IPv4 addresses to use as domain name servers. Use any different address inside subnet if not using it. |

Examples:

```yaml
---
ethernet:
  type: dhcp
```

```yaml
---
ethernet:
  type: static
  address: 192.168.5.1
  routers: 192.168.5.200
  dns: 192.168.5.200
```

#### Notes

If you need to mix this simple configuration tool with a more complex `dhcpcd.conf` file, use the following *armor* in your file:

```git
### config-network: start ###
### config-network: end ###
```

The script will set its properties in-between those lines, keeping the rest of your configuration.

Without an *armor*, configuration is appended at end of file, specifying `eth0` interface if missing (untouched `dhcpcd.conf`)

### `ap`

`ap` is itself an `object`.

| Member       | Kind       | Required | Function   |
|--------------|----------- |----------|------------|
| `ssid    `   | `string`   | **yes**  | SSID (Network Name)                                                                                        |
| `passphrase` | `string`   | no | Passphrase/password to connect to the network. Defaults to Open Network                                          |
| `address`    | `string`   | no | IP address to set on the wireless interface. Defaults to 192.168.2.1                                             |
| `channel`    | `integer`  | no | WiFi channel to use for the network (1-14). Defaults to `11`.                                                    |
| `country`    | `string`   | no | Country-code to apply frequencies limitations for. Defaults to `FR`                                              |
| `hide`       | `boolean`  | no | Hide SSID (Clients must know and enter its name to connect)                                                      |
| `interface`  | `string`   | no | Interface to configure AP for. Defaults to `wlan0`                                                               |
| `dhcp-range` | `string`   | no | IP range for AP clients. `start,end,subnet,ttl` format. Default: `.100-.240` from address                        |
| `network`    | `[string]` | no | Network to advertise DHCP on. Defaults to `.0/24` from address                                                   |
| `nodhcp-interfaces` | `[string]` | no | Interfaces where the DHCP server will not run |
| `dns`        | `[string]` | no | DNS to set via DHCP when working as Internet gateway. Defaults to `8.8.8.8`, `1.1.1.1`                           |
| `as-gateway` | `boolean`  | no | Make this device act as a gateway to Internet (wired) for AP (wireless) clients (when/if `eth0` has connectivity)|
| `tld`        | `string`   | no | Search (top-level) *domain* to set via DHCP. Defaults to `offspot`                                               |
| `domain`     | `string`   | no | Domain name to direct to the offspot. Defaults to `generic` (resolved as `generic.{tld}`                         |
| `welcome`    | `string`   | no | Additional domain to direct to offspot. Defaults to `goto.kiwix` (resolved as `goto.generic.{tld}`               |
| `spoof`      | `boolean`* | no | Whether to direct all DNS requests to the offspot. Useful for captive-portal without Internet bridge. Special value `auto` triggers it when the hotspot is offline and disables it when it is connected to Internet    |

#### notes

- `iptables` is not persistent. `ap` will write rules to `/etc/iptables/*.rules`. If you don't use `offspot-runtime-config-fromfile` on start, manually reload them via a script or service:

```sh
/usr/bin/find /etc/iptables/ -name '*.rules' -exec /sbin/iptables-restore {} \;
```

### `containers`

`containers` is the full docker-compose.yaml you want to use. It will be written to `/etc/docker/compose.yml`.

```yaml
---
containers:
  services:
    kiwix:
      container_name: kiwix
      image: ghcr.io/offspot/kiwix-serve:dev
      command: /bin/sh -c "kiwix-serve /data/*.zim"
      volumes:
        - "/data/zims:/data:ro"
      expose:
        - "80"
      restart: always
```
